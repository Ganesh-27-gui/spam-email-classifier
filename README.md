Mini project 
Spam Email Classifier using Machine Learning

This project uses the Naive Bayes algorithm to classify SMS messages as spam or not spam (ham).

Dataset

Source: SMS Spam Collection Dataset (available on Kaggle)

Contains 5,574 SMS messages labeled as ‘ham’ (not spam) or ‘spam’


Objective

Learn how machine learning can classify text data.

Apply Naive Bayes for binary classification.

Evaluate performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.


Technologies Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

Scikit-learn

Pandas, Matplotlib


Steps Performed

1. Load and clean the dataset


2. Convert text to numerical form using CountVectorizer


3. Train the model using MultinomialNB


4. Evaluate model performance (Accuracy ~97%)



How to Run

1. Clone or download the repo


2. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script



Results

Model accuracy: ~97%

High performance on binary classification task


Future Improvements

Use advanced NLP techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings

Deploy using a web interface (Flask/Streamlit)
